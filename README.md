# Skin-Lesion-Classification-with-Explainable-Deep-Learning
Deep learning–based multi-class skin lesion classification using EfficientNet, with Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ for model interpretability. Includes preprocessing pipeline, training code, evaluation metrics and explainability analysis.
This project was developed as the final project of CSCI-7335 (Image Processing) class in Georgia Southern University. It has not been published and has only been added to my portfolio.

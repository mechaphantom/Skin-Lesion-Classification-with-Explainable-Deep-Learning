# Skin Lesion Classification with Explainable Deep Learning
This project implements an EfficientNet-based deep learning pipeline for multi-class skin lesion classification on the ISIC BCN20000 dermoscopic dataset, and augments it with post-hoc explainability to make model decisions clinically interpretable. The system is trained via a two-phase strategy with transfer learning and fine-tuning on ten imbalanced lesion categories, and evaluated using accuracy, class-wise precision/recall/F1, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Results show moderate overall accuracy but strong discrimination for several common classes, with performance degrading on rare lesions due to class imbalance and visual overlap. To analyze model behavior beyond aggregate metrics, Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ are used to generate heatmaps that highlight the image regions driving each prediction, revealing that correct classifications typically focus on clinically meaningful lesion structures, while misclassifications often arise when attention shifts to artefacts or background. The study demonstrates that combining deep convolutional models with visual explanation tools provides a more trustworthy dermatological decision-support framework and outlines future directions such as better data balancing, segmentation-enhanced pipelines, and clinician-in-the-loop evaluation to improve robustness and usability in real-world settings.
